Development of a Novel Interactive Visual Task for Robot-Assisted Gait Training in Stroke

This project forms a part of the Masters Thesis of Amar Vamsi Krishna, in collaboration with Suchitra Chandar. 
Advised by Prof Anindo Roy

There are two game files

main-menu.py has a main menu interface which can take in the values of sensitivity, threshold torque, level progression parameters etc
the game.py contains the source code of the game file

The folder "examples" contains simple example scripts that can be seen to understand simple pygame/tkinter functinalities. 
The folder "fonts" contains the different fonts that would be used in the project
The folder "images" contains the different images used as objects, blits and background
The folder "ankle-data" contains the clinical data of the overground trials using the anklebot
the folder "audio" contains the audio files for the program
the folder "inc" contains various python modules that could be imported
the folder "material" ccontains reading material for the project - currently contains information about TCP/IP and Tkinter
the folder "utils" contains the various other files that can act as utilities. Currently contains a python script that can extract torque data from a text file

To understand the Examples, open the folder and see the readme text file inside. 

The python version used for development is 2.7.12
pygame is used to develop the game environment and game engine - version 1.9.3
