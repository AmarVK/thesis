The file 'game.py' contains the executable game file.
To run the game, Clone the repository (Or download the 'game.py' file)

The python version used for development is 2.7.12
pygame is used to develop the game environment and game engine - version 1.9.3

This version of the game displays a default window of size 800 x 600 pixels
The game caption is 'Game On!' which is displayed as the title
It displays the change of events - i.e. mouse movement/mouse clicks/keyboard inputs on the terminal screen
